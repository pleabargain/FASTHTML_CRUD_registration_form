Registration System
===================




This is a simple web-based Registration System built using FastHTML, a Python framework for creating web applications.

Features:
- User registration with multiple fields
- View all registrations
- Edit existing registrations
- Delete registrations
- Basic form validation

Requirements:
- Python 3.7+
- FastHTML library
- SQLite (included with Python)

Installation:
1. Ensure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed.
2. Install FastHTML:
   pip install fasthtml

Usage:
1. Run the application:
   python3 main.py
2. Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8000

File Structure:
- main.py: Contains the entire application code
- registrations.db: SQLite database file (created automatically)

Note: This is a basic implementation and does not include advanced features such as user authentication or data encryption. It is recommended to add proper security measures before using in a production environment.


# about
I wrote this with the help of a LLM and it is a very simple example. Cursor IDE made it super easy to write this reeadme I told it what I wanted and it wrote it for me. I wrote the code using Claude projects.
